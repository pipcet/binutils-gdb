@section WebAssembly backend
The WebAssembly module file format, at present, is a very simple
object file format with up to 11 numbered sections plus named
``custom'' subsections. At present, there is no standard for
relocations or symbols, though a @code{"name"} subsection can assign
names to function indices and local variables.

As such, it offers no real advantages over ELF, and intermediate ELF
files can be used to produce WebAssembly modules. The WebAssembly
backend aims to enable the opposite: reading a WebAssembly module and
producing an ELF file containing the same information, which can then
be manipulated and inspected with standard tools.
